aps106-problems
===============

C programs for UofT's APS106 for Winter 2014.

1. All my programs for labs and extra assignment questions will be here.
    * My Lab will be posted after the assigned time. No cheating!
    * I **HOPE** to have the Practice Problems done within the day it comes out.
2. It is very important for you to try it yourself, otherwise you don't learn! Programmming is a very independant course.
3. My commenting is sparse! Make sure to comment your work so both you and another fellow programmer can understand what you are doing. (I'm purposely not commenting, but if people are totally lost you can tell me)
4. If you have any suggestions to make, you can put up an issue or something.
5. You could also PM me or send an e-mail through utoronto.
