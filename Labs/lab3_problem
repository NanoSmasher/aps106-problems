APS106 - LAB #3
MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2:00 - 4:00
This lab will test your ability to use various selection constructs (if, else if, switch) in a program
that makes decisions based on the value of input. The extension of the source file must be .c, not
.cpp (e.g. lab3.c).
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat, calculated according to the
following equation based on Imperial units ( lbs – pounds, in – inches ):

BMI =       weight (lbs)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * 703
      height * height ( in )
      
      
For example, a person who weighs 220 lbs and is 6 feet 3 inches tall (there are 12 inches
in a foot) has a BMI of:

BMI  = 220/(75*75) * 703 = 27.5

Write a program that asks a user his/her weight (lbs) and height (ft and in), calculates a
value of the BMI, and then categorizes the weight according to the following:
    < 18.5 underweight
    18.5 – 25.0 normal weight
    25.0 – 30.0 overweight
    > 30.0 obese
    
For example, input and output might look like this:
Weight (lbs) : 220
  Height (ft/in) : 6 3
  
  Your BMI score is 27.5 - you’re overweight!

or like this:

Weight (lbs) : -45
  Height (ft/in) : 6 3
  I’m sorry; this input is invalid.
